# STM32H750B-DK_TouchGFX_FreeRTOS_MQTT_Example
## Introduction
<p align="justify"> This is a guide on how to create a working MQTT application with TouchGFX on STM32H750B-DK development board.  
This guide covers all issues I have encountered during the setup of my MQTT project.  
I created this guide due to the lack of any comprehensive tutorials for STM32H750B-DK.  </div>
